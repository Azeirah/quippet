### How do I use it?

Just press `alt-shift-q` to bring up the dialog.
Write down the snippets' content, its name, where it gets activated and the tab activation.

Quippet will automatically use any text you have selected when you open it up.

### where are the new snippets saved?

You can find your new snippets in the quippet package under the `snippets` folder.
They are saved as separate `.json` files.

### Note that you do NOT have to reload after a new snippet is added

Any snippet made with quippet will be automatically loaded into atom, so you can use them immediately,
unlike editing your `snippets.cson` file.
